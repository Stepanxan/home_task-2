0,Michelle M,Best slime ever,"We absolutely loved this slime. It’s super pretty with tons of metallic shine but not glitter that gets everywhere. The slime isn’t all sticky and goopey…it’s more together and so it makes no mess. It’s not super crazy stretchy, but I like that my girls can play with it without getting it all stuck in their hair or my carpet if it drops. The packaging was really on point too, and my girls loved popping open each globe to get their slime. We put them in goodie bags for my 6 year old’s bday, and everyone loved them!",5.0

 I was super disappointed by this slime. It has like no stretch to it. Like as soon as I opened it and tried it the slime broke to pieces in my hand. After a few rubs it softens but still has no real stretch to it so of course it's easy to clean. I was disappointed as planned to use them as stocking stuffers for my nephews. I was able to save it however by getting a Mason jar and putting water in it and leaving three if them in the jar over night. In the morning it was much more slime like. It still breaks apart but has a lot more stretch though also a bit sticky but not too much and still easy to clean.",2.0
24,jbrown46,Wish I had read the reviews,"I ordered these without looking at the reviews super closely, which is my mistake. Our package arrived intact, but out of 24, two are completely liquid and not slime at all. I needed all 24, so now I’m stuck trying to find two replacements. That said, the slime seems perfect for our Star Wars party bags but I can’t comment on the actual slime yet as we haven’t opened any of them.",3.0
25,Nina,Not the stretchy kind,"If you want the kind that can stretch and be folded back together, this is not it. It’s got a jello consistency and doesn’t last for more than a 10 min play time. One of the little containers was extremely watery.",3.0
26,Amazon Customer,Not very stretchy.,"My order arrived in tact with all of the slime balls. They look beautiful! There are 18 galaxy slimes and 6 single color slimes with plastic fruits and beads in them. Super cute!However, I opened one up to try it and the quality of the slime is rather low. I was not impressed. It doesn't stretch very far, instead it just kind of breaks. If you warm it up a bit it stretched a bit more but you have to do it very slowly. The colors also mixed together really quickly.On the bright side, it doesn't seem to stick to anything so it's pretty easy to clean up.Overall, I don't think I would buy these again.",3.0

I am picky about the slime we bring in... as so much of it sticks to the clothing.This was fun... they loved it... until we opened the balls and they just smashed it into tiny pieces of disappointment. I was sad...But then I just kept mindlessly playing with it and realized you have to really work the stuff together to make it malleable. The colors of course mix together more... which is probably why it's not as processed as it should be, to keep the colors clearer.Anyway, just in case anyone else had that issue.",4.0

As a parent I am thrilled with this slime as it doesn’t get stuck on the couch or on walls like other types of slime does!,5.0
46,Brooke B.,Finally a slime that doesn't stick to everything,"Love the texture of this slime. It doesn't stick to your hands or other objects. Purchased these for toddler gift bags and they were a huge hit! Came perfectly packaged and all were very colorful. If the slime comes apart after handling for awhile, just stick it back in the container and it will congeal again after 10 minutes. The colors will eventually run together making a purple/grayish color after playing with it about a dozen times, but that is expected. My toddler still finds it fun to play with.",5.0

It did smell pretty good, not like chemicals like the other manufactured slimes. But it did not stretch at all.  I checked all of them and all of them were exactly the same. It was very disappointing because although the product is for children, I have adult autism and I use those slimes as a stemming toy.

We counted out enough for her class and they attacked the rest! They are very happy with the product. 👍 The ""slime"" really is more of a putty. Which I prefer.

Alcune sfere hanno all'interno perline o animaletti, che piacciono alle bimbe. I colori sono vivaci e simpatici, prevalentemente sul blu e verde, ma anche rosa e arancio. Io le ho comprate come pensierino per i bimbi invitati alla festa di compleanno di mia figlia, avevano tutti tra 5 e 8 anni, e hanno apprezzato. Il prezzo è contenuto per il numero di perle presenti nella scatola: confezionate in una bella scatolina rettangolare colorata",
415,Amazon Customer,,The colours are really cool but the quality of the slime sucks. There’s no stretch and once it breaks apart it doesn’t go back together.

Gut finde ich, dass es einzelne Kugeln sind und man nicht auf einmal einen riesen Schleimbatzen hat.

Was nicht so toll ist, dass er etwas chemisch riecht und man den Schleim leider nicht so ziehen kann, wie beschrieben. Er ist relativ fest und bricht schnell auseinander. Er klebt auch super auf Teppichen u.ä. Also hier aufpassen!",

426,AF,,"I ordered this for my (almost) 3 year old daughter who LOVES slime. She was SO excited to open the pack and see 24 little tubs of slime, and immediately grabbed 4 tubs to open. As soon as she took the first one out of the package a piece fell off. She was in near tears and she ""broke"" the slime.  We grabbed another tub and when she tried to stretch the slime, it just ripped off. If she squeezed it, it broke into a million pieces, and she got tiny little globs of slime everywhere. She was so disappointed.  I recall reading some decently positive reviews, so I scrolled through and found a review that says you just have to work it in.  So I grabbed the slime from her, and ""kneaded"" the slime for 15 minutes.  Not only was it now in a million pieces all over my floor, my hands were covered in the galaxy slime, and it looks like something my dog would have thrown up. If you leave it to ""rest"", it all comes back together and has a nice sparkle to it.  So it's a nice ""look but don't touch"" slime... but who gets slime to just look at??I guess the positive side of the slime is that it looks pretty, so good to gift away, because it's not something I would want in my house.",

Der Schleim riecht nicht und klebt nicht, hinterlässt keine Schleimdpuren auf Tisch ect.. Wenn er geknetet wird, wird er etwas fester und kann als Kugel auch springen. Man kann ihn zerteilen und er fügt sich schnell wieder zu einer Masse zusammen.Die leeren Kugeln gehen leider etwas schnell kaputt. Wir haben dann in Plastikeier umgepackt.

435,braune Engel,,"Hallo,Wir haben es für unsere Tochter zum Geburtstag bestellt.Es ist vollständig und unbeschadet bei uns angekommen.Es ist bei unsere Tochter und den anderen Kindern ( Geschwister und Gäste) sehr gut angekommen. Auch wir Erwachsenen konnten nicht die Finger davon lassen.Ich kenne noch den Gliebber von meiner Kindheit und der Geruch ( der schon etwas eigenwillig ist) hat mich sofort in meiner kindheitserinnerung versetzt.Minimal klebrig... Daher zu empfehlen es nicht auf Teppiche, decken, oder sandige Untergrund zu bespielen.Was sehr schön ist :Die FarbenGute einzelne Portionsgrössen ( zum teilen wichtig😉)Der extra Glipper in der untersten Reihe der durchsichtig ist und kleinere Gegenstände eingearbeitet ist..... machen das Set vollständig und lassen für uns keine spielwünsche offen.Das einzige was etwas schade ist:Der Gliebber ist ja in einzelne kreisrunde Plastikbehälter porzioniert ( was ja sehr schön ist) doch das Plastik ist sehr dünn und spröde.... Was zu Folge hat das es bei minimalen druck kaputt geht..... und somit die Aufbewahrung des Gliebber etwas schwieriger macht.Tip hier: Wir haben uns da mit leere ü-eier geholfenWir sind bis auf den kleinen Verpackungs sache sehr zufrieden und geben wegen dem spielspass und der Menge an Gliebber 5 SterneIch hoffe die Bewertung hilft euchLg",

Totally just shy of £35 for two sets........These “slimes” are no longer slime....... I believe at one point they would have been “slime” but clearly these have been stored in the wrong environment (that’s My guess due to them been so cold on opening tubes) & they have turned to gel that just tears apart.I was gutted for my 2 year old who’s taken a big liking to my nieces slime collection. These are stunning..... very pretty and eye catching......... but aren’t any good for kids to play with unless they like crumbling useless Gel.Thankfully I got my money back on both sets as I returned them as they aren’t fit for purpose for sure.,

They are more like a putty rather than slime, my girls are 3 & 8 and they love them.Perfect for little ones however there are some small bits & pieces in the 5 clear/colour slimes so I'd advise adult supervision if like my 3 year old, they like to put things in their mouth.",

After a few rubs it softens but still has no real stretch to it so of course it's easy to clean. I was disappointed as planned to use them as stocking stuffers for my nephews. I was able to save it however by getting a Mason jar and putting water in it and leaving three if them in the jar over night. In the morning it was much more slime like.

I was not impressed. It doesn't stretch very far, instead it just kind of breaks. If you warm it up a bit it stretched a bit more but you have to do it very slowly. The colors also mixed together really quickly.On the bright side, it doesn't seem to stick to anything so it's pretty easy to clean up.Overall, I don't think I would buy these again.",3.0

Though I did expect them to be slightly larger. It's fairly non-sticky on hands, but DO NOT get it on fabric. The couch is literally ruined where the slime leaked on it. The slime fused to the microfiber and has been impossible to get off. It's mind boggling that they don't protect them better for shipping. What a waste.",1.0

They were bought as stocking stuffers for a preschool classroom because I thought they’d be nice but they’re such a waste of money.,1.0

Alcune sfere hanno all'interno perline o animaletti, che piacciono alle bimbe. I colori sono vivaci e simpatici, prevalentemente sul blu e verde, ma anche rosa e arancio. Io le ho comprate come pensierino per i bimbi invitati alla festa di compleanno di mia figlia, avevano tutti tra 5 e 8 anni, e hanno apprezzato. Il prezzo è contenuto per il numero di perle presenti nella scatola: confezionate in una bella scatolina rettangolare colorata",
1084,Amazon Customer,,The colours are really cool but the quality of the slime sucks. There’s no stretch and once it breaks apart it doesn’t go back together.

Nonostante alcune recensioni negative sulla consistenza dello slime,  ho rischiato, le ho scelte perché sembrano dei piccoli pianeti e sembravano perfette per il tema Spazio che avevamo scelto.

1086,AnGra,,"Ich habe diese Schleimkugeln für meine Tochter bestellt. Sie hat sich sehr darüber gefreut. Gut finde ich, dass es einzelne Kugeln sind und man nicht auf einmal einen riesen Schleimbatzen hat. So kann man immer mal eine Kugel öffnen und den "" Schleim"" nachdem Spielen wieder in der Kugel verstauen. Er sieht auch sehr schön aus und hat teilweise kleine Figuren drin. Was nicht so toll ist, dass er etwas chemisch riecht und man den Schleim leider nicht so ziehen kann, wie beschrieben. Er ist relativ fest und bricht schnell auseinander. Er klebt auch super auf Teppichen u.ä. Also hier aufpassen!",

1095,AF,,"I ordered this for my (almost) 3 year old daughter who LOVES slime. She was SO excited to open the pack and see 24 little tubs of slime, and immediately grabbed 4 tubs to open. As soon as she took the first one out of the package a piece fell off. She was in near tears and she ""broke"" the slime.  We grabbed another tub and when she tried to stretch the slime, it just ripped off. If she squeezed it, it broke into a million pieces, and she got tiny little globs of slime everywhere. She was so disappointed.  I recall reading some decently positive reviews, so I scrolled through and found a review that says you just have to work it in.  So I grabbed the slime from her, and ""kneaded"" the slime for 15 minutes.  Not only was it now in a million pieces all over my floor, my hands were covered in the galaxy slime, and it looks like something my dog would have thrown up. If you leave it to ""rest"", it all comes back together and has a nice sparkle to it.  So it's a nice ""look but don't touch"" slime... but who gets slime to just look at??I guess the positive side of the slime is that it looks pretty, so good to gift away, because it's not something I would want in my house.",

Der Schleim riecht nicht und klebt nicht, hinterlässt keine Schleimdpuren auf Tisch ect.. Wenn er geknetet wird, wird er etwas fester und kann als Kugel auch springen. Man kann ihn zerteilen und er fügt sich schnell wieder zu einer Masse zusammen.Die leeren Kugeln gehen leider etwas schnell kaputt. Wir haben dann in Plastikeier umgepackt. Auch nach 3 Monaten ist der offene Schleim noch top.Es hatten nicht nur die Kinder Spaß. ;)Ich würde ihn auch nochmal kaufen.",

Was zu Folge hat das es bei minimalen druck kaputt geht..... und somit die Aufbewahrung des Gliebber etwas schwieriger macht.Tip hier: Wir haben uns da mit leere ü-eier geholfenWir sind bis auf den kleinen Verpackungs sache sehr zufrieden und geben wegen dem spielspass und der Menge an Gliebber 5 SterneIch hoffe die Bewertung hilft euchLg",

I believe at one point they would have been “slime” but clearly these have been stored in the wrong environment (that’s My guess due to them been so cold on opening tubes) & they have turned to gel that just tears apart.I was gutted for my 2 year old who’s taken a big liking to my nieces slime collection. These are stunning..... very pretty and eye catching......... but aren’t any good for kids to play with unless they like crumbling useless Gel.Thankfully I got my money back on both sets as I returned them as they aren’t fit for purpose for sure.,

I needed a spray cleaner not only to clean, but also to zap the ants that invade annually, since the ant-killer I purchased, which the ants supposed to take back to their nests, attracts the little blighters by the kazillions; they love it so much that they never want to leave; and the only effective ant killers on offer seem to be suffering from the same problem as spray cleaners: difficult to find, except in industrial quantities, and way too expensive!Like the House that Jack built, the Clorox spray killed the ants on contact, and the gloves protected my hands—or I should say 'the *glove* protected my *hand*', because I found it, if not impossible, too much of a hassle, to put on the second glove after I managed to put the first glove on, since these gloves are completely inflexible. Words, in fact, almost fail me to describe these semi-shapeless artefacts.Clunky, lumpy, and blobby, don't quite do the trick, but they're the best I can come up with, since finding the appropriate word is about as annoying as trying to put on the second glove.

We have now (finally) used up these gloves and thank goodness for that! They were probably the worst disposable gloves I've ever used. They are thin, which isn't bad in itself, but they are also very delicate and rip easily, especially at the wrists when donning them. I'm honestly not sure how it's possible, but even when they don't have visible holes, liquids seep in through the vinyl. They must have very small perforations or actually be liquid permeable, which really defeats the purpose of gloves. We use them to work with staining dyes and it's very obvious when a glove fails. This happened with probably 75% or more of the gloves from this supplier. They might work okay as a barrier from large solids, if that's what you want gloves for, but I wouldn't trust them with anything serious.

If you want some cheap gloves, get them a size bigger than you need. I also find powdering my hands helps a lot, but all the science says that powder is not good for patients.
